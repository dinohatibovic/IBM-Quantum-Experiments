Verified quantum computing experiments on real IBM hardware.

- ibm_fez — 156 qubits, Heron R2
- ibm_torino — 133 qubits, Heron R1

## Key Results

| Experiment | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Bell fidelity | 94.4% (C=0.888) |
| BB84 QBER degradation | 82× |
| Reproducibility | χ²=2.70, p=0.44 |
| Total shots | 39,010 |

Note: job `d5sd9mveglic739vatm0` (previously reported as 96.3% Bell fidelity)
is flagged as anomalous — its measured distribution is concentrated in a single
basis state (Shannon entropy 0.278), which is inconsistent with a Bell state in
the computational basis. Its fidelity/concurrence metrics are recorded as N/A
in the dataset; the best verified Bell result is 94.4% (job
`d5sd2ioubqnc73c4im80`, 4000 shots).

Documentation index:

- `docs/JOB_IDS.md` — IBM Quantum job identifiers.
- `docs/PARSER_FUNCTION_MAP.md` — parser function index.
- `docs/DATA_AVAILABILITY.md` — current data availability manifest.
- `docs/REPOSITORY_MAP.md` — full repository layout.
- `docs/CHECKSUMS.md` — how release file checksums are generated and verified.
- `docs/RUNTIME_SAFETY.md` — parser runtime/safety notes.
- `docs/ARXIV_PREP.md` — honest checklist of what's needed before an arXiv submission.
- `docs/NATURE_READINESS.md` — honest gap analysis against npj Quantum Information submission guidelines.

Empty reserved directories (`analysis/`, `notebooks/`, `tests/`, `data/results/`, `data/circuits/`, `data/calibration/`, `data/raw_bitarrays/`) are tracked with `.gitkeep` and intentionally contain no placeholder code — they are populated only when real content exists (see `docs/NATURE_READINESS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` for the rationale). `latex/` is no longer empty (see `docs/ARXIV_PREP.md`).

## Data Availability

This repository currently includes processed CSV results, a statistical PDF report, parser code and experiment figures. Raw IBM JSON exports, QASM circuit files and backend calibration exports are not currently included.

See `docs/DATA_AVAILABILITY.md` for the current file availability status.

## Figures

Experiment figures are available in `figures/`:
